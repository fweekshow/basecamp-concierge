ROCKY: EVENT INFRASTRUCTURE FRAMEWORK
The Future of Event Technology and Agent-Powered Experiences

SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM
Events today are fragmented experiences. Attendees juggle multiple apps, miss important updates, struggle with logistics, and organizers lack direct communication channels with their audience. Traditional event platforms are static, impersonal, and don't create lasting engagement beyond the event dates.

Current pain points:
- Scattered information across websites, emails, and apps
- No real-time, personalized assistance during events
- Limited attendee engagement and community building
- Organizers have no direct line to attendees
- Post-event engagement drops to zero
- No monetization opportunities for ongoing relationships

SLIDE 2: MEET ROCKY TODAY
Rocky started as the Basecamp 2025 Concierge - an AI agent that revolutionized how 500+ attendees experienced a premium crypto event. Built on XMTP for real-time messaging, Rocky provided instant schedule updates, personalized reminders, group coordination, and 24/7 concierge support.

What Rocky does now:
- Real-time schedule management and updates
- Personalized reminder system with timezone handling
- Group chat creation and management for activities
- Broadcasting system for event-wide announcements
- Sidebar conversations for focused discussions
- Emergency communication channels
- Integration with event websites for accurate information

The results were immediate: attendees stayed informed, engaged, and connected throughout the entire event experience.

SLIDE 3: STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT WITH BASE
Rocky directly supports Base's key strategic priority: building their social app. Events are natural content creation environments, and Rocky becomes the bridge that brings authentic, engaging social activity directly into Base app's social feed.

The Base social opportunity:
- Base is actively building and promoting their social app
- Events generate massive amounts of authentic, shareable content
- Rocky enables seamless social sharing: users can share pictures in group chats and say "@rocky post this"
- Every event becomes a content engine feeding Base app's social feed
- Viral growth potential as event content drives user acquisition to Base app

SLIDE 4: THE EVOLUTION
Rocky is evolving from a single-event concierge into a comprehensive Event Infrastructure Framework that powers Base's social ecosystem. This isn't just about scaling one agent - it's about creating an entire ecosystem where every event gets its own intelligent agent, complete with ticketing integration and social amplification.

The transformation:
- From single-use agent to agent-generation platform
- From event support to full event infrastructure and social amplification
- From basic ticketing to intelligent ticket management
- From temporary engagement to lasting community building
- From cost center to revenue generator and viral growth engine

SLIDE 5: THE VISION - AGENT-POWERED EVENTS
Every event deserves its own Rocky. Our platform will allow event organizers to deploy custom AI agents in minutes, not months. Each agent comes pre-configured with event-specific knowledge, ticketing integration, and community management tools.

The new Rocky ecosystem:
- One-click agent deployment for any event
- Automatic website crawling and knowledge base creation
- Integrated ticketing system with smart contracts
- Token generation for each event community
- Cross-event networking and discovery
- Revenue sharing and monetization tools

Event organizers get a complete infrastructure solution. Attendees get personalized, intelligent assistance. Base gets authentic social content. Everyone wins.

SLIDE 6: THE MINIAPP EXPERIENCE
Built natively on Base, our miniapp is a unified platform with two core functions: Agent Creation and Ticketing. This integrated approach means organizers can build their event agent and set up ticketing in one seamless flow, while attendees can discover, purchase, and engage all in one place.

The miniapp has two main sections:

Agent Creation Side:
- Enter event details and website URL
- Select agent capabilities from our tool library
- Customize branding and messaging
- Deploy agent with automatic ticketing integration
- Launch with built-in token for community building

Ticketing Side:
- Discover events through intelligent recommendations
- Purchase tickets with integrated smart contracts
- Automatic agent access upon ticket purchase
- Token distribution with every ticket
- Cross-event networking and community features

Social Integration:
- Share photos in event group chats with "@rocky post this" command
- Automatic posting to Base app social feed with event context
- Token rewards for social engagement and content creation
- Viral discovery as friends see event content on Base app

This unified experience eliminates the friction between ticketing, engagement, and social sharing, creating a seamless journey from discovery to viral community participation.

SLIDE 7: TICKETING REVOLUTION
Traditional ticketing is broken. High fees, poor user experience, no ongoing relationship with attendees, and zero post-event value. Our integrated ticketing system built directly into the miniapp changes everything.

Revolutionary ticketing features:
- Seamless integration with agent creation in one platform
- Zero platform fees for organizers
- Instant ticket delivery through XMTP
- Smart contract-based ticket verification
- Automatic refunds and transfers
- Dynamic pricing based on demand
- Immediate agent access upon ticket purchase
- Community token distribution with every ticket
- Post-event utility and rewards

Each ticket becomes a gateway to an ongoing relationship with the event's AI agent, not just event access. Attendees hold valuable digital assets that appreciate over time while getting personalized assistance throughout their event journey.

SLIDE 8: MONETIZATION ECOSYSTEM
Rocky creates multiple revenue streams for both platform and event organizers. This isn't just about ticket sales - it's about building lasting economic relationships around events and tapping into massive markets like festivals.

Revenue opportunities:
- Festival partnerships and multi-day event management
- Premium agent features and customizations
- Social media integration driving Base app viral growth
- Advanced analytics and attendee insights
- White-label solutions for large organizations
- Token launch services for event communities
- Cross-event advertising and sponsorships
- Marketplace for event-related services
- Revenue sharing from successful events
- Festival merchandise and vendor coordination

Festival market alone represents billions in annual revenue. Event organizers can monetize their communities long after the event ends. We take a small percentage of the value we create, ensuring aligned incentives.

SLIDE 9: THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
While others focus on static event platforms or basic chatbots, Rocky combines the best of AI agents, blockchain technology, and real-time messaging into a cohesive experience.

Our unique advantages:
- Proven technology with real event success
- XMTP integration for true decentralized messaging
- Base blockchain for seamless onchain experiences
- Modular agent system for rapid customization

- Cross-event networking effects
- Developer-friendly platform for extensions

We're not just building another event platform - we're creating the infrastructure for the future of events.

SLIDE 10: VIRAL GROWTH ENGINE - SOCIAL AT EVENTS
Events are social media goldmines. Attendees naturally document and share their experiences, creating massive organic content that could explode Base app engagement. Rocky becomes the bridge between real-world events and onchain social activity.

The social opportunity:
- Festival attendees post 50-100 photos per event on average
- Event hashtags regularly trend with millions of impressions
- User-generated content drives 6x higher engagement than brand content
- Events create authentic, shareable moments that algorithms love
- Base app social feed gets flooded with real-world event content

Rocky's social integration:
- Seamless photo sharing directly to Base app social feed
- Automatic event tagging and community building
- Token rewards for social engagement and content creation
- Cross-event social discovery and networking
- Viral loops as friends see event content and want to attend
- Festival partnerships creating massive content waves

Every event becomes a content creation engine feeding the Base ecosystem. One major festival could generate millions of social posts, driving massive user acquisition and engagement for Base app.

SLIDE 11: MARKET OPPORTUNITY
The global event management software market is worth over 7 billion dollars and growing rapidly. But this misses the bigger picture - we're creating an entirely new category at the intersection of events, AI, and blockchain, with festivals representing a massive untapped opportunity.
